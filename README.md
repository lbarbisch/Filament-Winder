# Filament-Winder

This setup was built to wind from a 4.5kg spool to a 1kg spool.  
It is very slow (~0.5h for 1kg) but it works and does not need babysitting.  
\
The idler makes for a even winding pattern and the limit of 600 revolutions fills the spool tu just the right amount, so it will fits in my AMS unit.

The code and the STEP file are included if anyone wants to build one.
